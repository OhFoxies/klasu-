#What is klasuś? 
Klasuś is a simple discord bot that uses API of my school's online gradebook.
It uses a [Vulcan-API](https://github.com/kapi2289/vulcan-api) to fetch all data.
Klasuś was made because of requests from my friends to autamatize all daily tasks.

#What does klasuś do?
Klasuś daily check a **lucky number** and sends it to the channel and pings a user 
with this number in gradebook. It also weekly sends a list of THE WHITE BOARDS WHIPERS.
Klasuś is very cool boy, and it will tell you about changes in plan and about new test.

#Why klasuś?
Kerfuś.
