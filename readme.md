# What is klasuś?
Klasuś is a simple discord bot that uses API of my school's online grade book.
It uses a [Vulcan-API](https://github.com/kapi2289/vulcan-api) to fetch all data.
Its currently in bot's files - it's not imported.

Klasuś was made because of requests from my friends to automatize all daily tasks.

# What does klasuś do?
Klasuś daily check a **lucky number** and sends it to the channel and pings a user 
with this number in grade book. It also weekly sends a list of THE WHITE BOARDS WIPERS. 

U can add klasuś to your own discord server: [Klasus](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1042467869138624532&permissions=8&scope=bot).
Klasuś supports unlimited classes and groups in classes for each server if you have discord 
server with friends from different classes you can easily configure bot to support them all. 
Have fun!
# How it works?
